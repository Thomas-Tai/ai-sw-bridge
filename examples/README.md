# Examples

Worked examples for ai-sw-bridge. Each subfolder is a self-contained workflow you can run end-to-end.

## v0.2 examples (JSON spec → direct-COM build)

Run with `ai-sw-build <path>/spec.json --no-dim`. Recommended order:

| Example | Features | What it demonstrates |
|---|---|---|
| [`filleted_box/`](filleted_box/) | 3 | Simplest example: box + fillet. Start here. |
| [`minimal_cylinder_v2/`](minimal_cylinder_v2/) | 2 | Parametric cylinder with `{rhs}` bindings |
| [`motor_mount_plate/`](motor_mount_plate/) | 10 | Full MMP: 6 primitives, face sketches on both sides, multi-circle hole patterns |
| [`tension_bracket/`](tension_bracket/) | 8 | Stacked extrudes, face-sketch-origin offset workaround |

## v0.3 examples (new primitives)

| Example | Features | What it demonstrates |
|---|---|---|
| [`chamfered_box/`](chamfered_box/) | 3 | `chamfer_edge` in equal-distance mode |
| [`patterned_plate/`](patterned_plate/) | 5 | `linear_pattern` of a hole feature along an edge direction |
| [`mirrored_holes/`](mirrored_holes/) | 5 | `mirror_feature` of a hole about Right Plane |

Each ships with a README that walks through the feature list and the gotchas specific to that primitive. The pattern + mirror primitives depend on `SelectByID2` working under late-binding for marked-selection — if you hit a `SelectByID2 returned False` error, run the corresponding spike under [`../spikes/v0_3/`](../spikes/v0_3/) to diagnose.

## v0.4 examples (side faces + simple_hole)

| Example | Features | What it demonstrates |
|---|---|---|
| [`side_face_bosses/`](side_face_bosses/) | 6 | Boss extrudes on all four side faces (`±x`, `±y`) — verifies sketch-origin handling on non-`±z` faces |
| [`drilled_plate/`](drilled_plate/) | 4 | `simple_hole` primitive: blind + through_all variants side by side |

## v0.5 examples (revolve)

| Example | Features | What it demonstrates |
|---|---|---|
| [`revolved_ring/`](revolved_ring/) | 2 | `revolve_boss` primitive + `centerline` field on plane sketch. Profile rectangle revolved 360° about an embedded centerline → hollow tube. |

## Path C example (recorded-macro parameterization)

| Example | What it demonstrates |
|---|---|
| [`minimal_cylinder/`](minimal_cylinder/) | Record a cylinder in SW UI, parameterize against `locals.txt`, replay in VBE. Validates full Path C workflow. |

## Running an example

**v0.2 examples** — open SOLIDWORKS, then:

```powershell
ai-sw-build examples/filleted_box/spec.json --no-dim
```

**Path C example** — follow the step-by-step instructions in that folder's `README.md`.

## Notes

- Examples with `{rhs}` bindings reference a `locals.txt` file. Some use a machine-specific absolute path — update the `locals` field in `spec.json` to point to your copy, or replace `{rhs}` expressions with literal mm values.
- Path C expects you to record your own `.swp` macro (recordings are machine- and version-specific — see [docs/known_gotchas.md](../docs/known_gotchas.md)).
